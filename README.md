# FiniteAutomataGenerator-for-JFLAP
Random automata generator compatilble with JFLAP tool. Project for my IT studies 

To generate an automata you have to type number of states (n), number of final states (fs) and alphabet as charstring ending with "*". The result is an XML file with .jff extension. You can open it with JFLAP. Used algorythm is Gnp model with p = 0.5.
